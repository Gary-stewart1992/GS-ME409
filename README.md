# GS-ME409
Individual Project code

#Hello, this is my code for my BEng dissertation on studying the feasibility of applying electric propulsion for end of life satellites. 

#this model can apply constant thrust to transfer a satellite between orbits. 

#if you would like to use the script please define your initial conditions in the main script, mass, area, ISP, thrust ect.  
propogate the orbit within the main script, the script is fully working and there shouldnt be any need to edit the tools or orbit propagato function. 

#two line elements which have satellite data built in have been provided in the TLE folder.

# GS-ME409
ME409, ME420, ME21 Individual Project Code

Hello, 

My 4th year research project at the University of Strathclyde was an "Investigation into using Electric Propulsion (EP) in the Design of an Autonomous Failsafe Device to Perform End-of-Life Manoeuvres for Satellites in MEO and GEO."

As part of methodology for the project was to construct a programme that could simulate constant thrust spiral manoeuvres using pertubation theory in order to assess the various thrusters.

The programme is ran from 'Main Script.py' which requires information regarding the satellites state and thrust/pertubations. 
  The orbit propagator class was built to be used with state vectors, orbital elements and two-elements as input 
  all required pertubation input is included in null_perts dictionary
